# Gade2D
A 2d game engine which utilizes libGDX, programmed in Java. 




Introduction/History
====================

Gade2D is a long-running side project of mine, meant to be a Top-Down 2d game engine which is designed for adventure games. Development was started in 2016 as a small project I undertook in High-School, where the goal was to make an engine which helped me understand programming. The first iteration was written with the Java2D API, a 2D graphics library intended for desktop applications. By the time the project was finished, it had a rudimentary tile-based level system, a working entity system, useable weapons, and a text and menu system. The project itself was fairly complex for a beginner project, as it involved multiple systems which helped me understand the fundamentals of OOP and Java.

Many of the original iterations are unreleased and were merely learning endeavors for my later projects. This version on github is a very unfinished project which is extremely buggy and probably does not work, as I have not tested anything since a few years. Please contact me if you'd like for the repository to be updated as I could probably iron some bugs out and maybe even create a small 'game' out of it.

Introduction/History
====================

Gade2D is a long-running side project of mine, meant to be a Top-Down 2d game engine which is designed for adventure games. Development was started in 2016 as a small project I undertook in High-School, where the goal was to make an engine which helped me understand programming as a tool to create and develop software. The first iteration was written with the Java2D API, a barebones 2D graphics library intended for web and desktop applications. By the time the project was finished, it had a rudimentary tile-based level system, a working entity system, useable weapons, and a text and menu system. The project itself was fairly complex for a beginner project, as it involved multiple systems and cohesive concepts which would require a deeper knowledge of Object-Oriented programming.
